Hi Bosco,
How are things going at Biochem?

I've been running around trying to organise the Sydney move. The Sydney rental market is cut-throat, but we finally managed to get a decent place in Stanmore. Phew!

Anyhow, I'm starting to return my attention to our NCC paper.

Attached are two files that I need you to process for me:

File 1) 150310 retreived list of beta23 interactors from Olzscha et al 2011 v2 (for Bosco).xlsx

When you get a chance, could you please run this list of proteins through your modiDB script to determine their % disorder. The identifier that you should use for this list is found in Column A (and is entitled "entry").


File 2) 150310 AT3 experiment overview from proteinGroups (for Bosco).xlsx

This is another SILAC experiment that I performed but using mouse AT3 cells. As with the prior SILAC experiments, MaxQuant has assigned multiple IDs to each entry. When you get a chance, could you please provide the best reviewed sequence ID for each proteins. The multiple identifier can be found in Column A (and is entitled "Protein IDs").

Thanks for this. Cheers,
