Hi Bosco
Thanks for offering to help with this dataset. I have placed data in peptagram_summary folder \ KL-peptide-overlap
I have put in the csv input file containing the following columns
1) Sequence
2) Protein
3) Protein Description
4) Length 

I have also included the fasta database. 

Would be great to know if the peptides (from same protein) are close to each other or away from each other or just overlap. 
Here are the proposed columns for the output:

Same 4 as input plus
-Start
-End ( position of peptide in protein)
-Overlaps (whether it overlaps with any other peptide in list)
-3aa ( Mark X if it has peptides that start or end within 3 aa from either termini of this peptide)
-4aa (same as above but 4aa region)
-5 aa
